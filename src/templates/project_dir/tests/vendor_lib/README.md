# vendor\_lib

This is used to store (pretty much) verbatim copies of libraries
that somebody else has written, and that you don't need to change.

You're not really supposed to edit with your tests.

If you do need to make changes here, they either need to be deployed
along with other new projects OR they shouldn't be here.
