# ias_package_shell

A template processing system with emphasis on creating project directories.

IAS Package Shell was developed from the standpoint of:

* Only requiring packages that are available in either base repositories
or repositories that have large community support (e.g. EPEL)
* Functioning on both Debian and RPM based systems after only having
installed those dependencies

The current main project layout, "Full Project" is:

* version control system agnostic
* packaging system agnostic
* programming language agnostic (for scripting languages)
* distribution agnostic
* deployment system agnostic

Examples for multiple scripting languages can be found here:

* https://github.com/mvanwinkleias/repo_layout_demo1

This layout is known to be compatible with:

* PHP: Composer
* Python: pupenv
* Perl
* Ruby: Gems (see artifact-name/gem)
* Bash

Additionally, project directory templates have been created for the following:

* Autotools + Simple C program: https://github.com/mvanwinkleias/mv_c_package_template_test/tree/master/src/templates/c_project_template
* Autotools + C program with libraries: https://github.com/mvanwinkleias/mv_c_package_template_test/tree/master/src/templates/c_library_template
* Autotools + [mpicc](https://www.mpich.org/):  https://github.com/mvanwinkleias/mv_c_package_template_test/tree/master/src/templates/c_mpi_project

all of which install manual pages, info pages, and can have Debian packages generated by
issuing a single command.


# Supplemental Documentation

Supplemental documentation for this project can be found here:

* [Supplemental Documentation](./doc/index.md)

# Synopsis (a _very_ short example)

```
ias_package_shell.pl
```

And answer questions.  It will create a project tree for you.

Put a simple shell file in it into src/bin .

Then, provided the first line of the changelog contains the package name,
and the version of the package you want to release:

## RPM

```
fakeroot make package-rpm
```

## DEB

```
fakeroot make package-deb
```

## Install the Generated Package

RHEL based:

```
yum localinstall -y ...
```

Debian based:

```
gdebi ...
```

Your script you put into bin will be installed to

* /opt/IAS/bin/package-name/script_name.sh

## Side Note

If you don't care about tags, or releases, this _simplified_ might be good enough for you.

Just remember to commit the changelog, and increase the version numbers correctly
so your package management system knows how to handle upgrades.

I, personally, recommend following a release process (which is documented in the
[Supplemental Documentation](./doc/index.md)).

# Installation

## Check Out the Source

The script should run just fine if you check it out, install the dependencies in
rpm_specific (rpm systems), or deb_control (deb systems) and run it.

## Building a Package

You can build a package and install it, which will take care of the dependencies and install into:

* /opt/IAS/bin/ias-package-shell/ias_package_shell.pl


### Requirements

All of the requisite things can be installed via packages.

#### All Systems

* fakeroot

#### Debian

* build-essential

#### RPM Based Systems

* rpm-build

### Building a Debian package

```
  fakeroot make package-deb
```

### Building an RPM

```
fakeroot make package-rpm
```
